# Bloom Supporter Identity

**Discover your supporter personality—straight from your conversations.**

Are you a Visionary who jumps on new tools early? An Explorer trying everything? A Cultivator building communities? An Optimizer fine-tuning workflows? Or an Innovator pushing boundaries?

Find out in seconds with Bloom Supporter Identity.

## 🎯 What You Get

Your personalized Bloom Supporter Identity Card reveals:

- **🎴 Your Supporter Type** – Visionary, Explorer, Cultivator, Optimizer, or Innovator
- **💬 Custom Tagline** – A one-liner that captures your vibe ("First to try new AI tools")
- **📊 2x2 Dimensions** – Conviction vs. Intuition, showing how you make decisions
- **🏷️ Top Categories** – AI Tools, Productivity, Consumer Apps—where you spend your energy
- **🎯 Tool Recommendations** – The top 5 tools matched to your profile
- **🔗 Shareable Card** – Show off your supporter identity
- **🤖 Agent Wallet** – Ready for tipping creators (powered by Coinbase on Base)

## ⚡️ How It Works

Simple: just type `/bloom` in your chat.

We analyze your last ~120 messages to understand:
- **What excites you** (AI agents? productivity hacks? creative tools?)
- **How you engage** (deep dives vs. quick experiments)
- **Your supporter archetype** (early adopter or wait-and-see?)

**No complex setup. No wallet signatures. No auth flows.**
Just pure conversation intelligence.

## 🚀 Usage

```
/bloom
```

That's it. Or use natural language:
```
"discover my supporter type"
"what's my bloom identity"
"create my supporter card"
```

Works with as few as 3 messages—but richer history = deeper insights.

## 🌟 Why Bloom Supporter Identity?
