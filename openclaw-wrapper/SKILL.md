# Bloom Taste Finder

**Discover your builder taste—straight from your conversations.**

## ⚠️ Permissions & Capabilities

This skill requires the following permissions:

**📖 Read Conversations** - Analyzes your last ~120 messages to understand your interests and supporter type. Raw conversation text stays local; only analysis results are used.

**🌐 External Network** - Connects to Bloom Protocol API to:
- Generate your shareable dashboard URL
- Store your identity card (personality type, tagline, categories)
- Enable future features (skill recommendations, creator tipping)

**🔐 Agent Wallet (Optional)** - Creates a blockchain wallet on Base network (Coinbase CDP) for future tipping features. This is generated automatically but not required for basic functionality.

**Your Control**: Your conversation is analyzed locally. You decide whether to share your identity card publicly via the dashboard link.

Are you a Visionary who jumps on new tools early? An Explorer trying everything? A Cultivator building communities? An Optimizer fine-tuning workflows? Or an Innovator pushing boundaries?

Find out in seconds with Bloom Supporter Identity.

## 🎯 What You Get

Your personalized Bloom Supporter Identity Card reveals:

- **🎴 Your Supporter Type** – Visionary, Explorer, Cultivator, Optimizer, or Innovator
- **💬 Custom Tagline** – A one-liner that captures your vibe ("First to try new AI tools")
- **📊 2x2 Dimensions** – Conviction vs. Intuition, showing how you make decisions
- **🏷️ Top Categories** – AI Tools, Productivity, Consumer Apps—where you spend your energy
- **🎯 Tool Recommendations** – The top 5 tools matched to your profile
- **🔗 Shareable Card** – Show off your supporter identity
- **🤖 Agent Wallet** – Ready for tipping creators (powered by Coinbase on Base)

## ⚡️ How It Works

Simple: just type `/bloom` in your chat.

We analyze your last ~120 messages to understand:
- **What excites you** (AI agents? productivity hacks? creative tools?)
- **How you engage** (deep dives vs. quick experiments)
- **Your supporter archetype** (early adopter or wait-and-see?)

**No complex setup. No wallet signatures. No auth flows.**
Just pure conversation intelligence.

## ✅ New User Quick Start (ClawHub)

1) **Chat a little first** (at least 3 messages) so Bloom has context.
2) Type **`/bloom`**.
3) You’ll get your **Identity Card + tool recommendations + dashboard link**.
4) If you’re brand new, Bloom will ask **4 quick questions** and generate your card immediately.

## 🚀 Usage

```
/bloom
```

That's it. Or use natural language:
```
"discover my supporter type"
"what's my bloom identity"
"create my supporter card"
```

Works with as few as 3 messages—but richer history = deeper insights.

## 🌟 Why Bloom Taste Finder?

**For Indie Devs & AI Builders:**
Building something new? Bloom Taste Finder helps you **find your first 100 supporters** by matching you with tools and people who fit your vibe.

**For Vibe Coders:**
Stop guessing what tools to try next. Get personalized recommendations based on how you actually work, not generic listicles. **Discover skills you'll actually use** instead of scrolling endless lists.

**For Consumer AI Enthusiasts:**
**Find AI tools that match your vibe**. Search by supporter type (Visionary, Explorer, etc.) to connect with others who work like you. Rally early adopters for bold launches. Engage optimizers for feedback loops.

## 📋 Requirements

- **Minimum 3 messages** in your conversation (more is better)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**"Insufficient conversation data"**
→ Need at least 3 messages. Keep chatting about tools you're interested in!

**"Command not found"**
→ Verify `bloom-identity-skill` is in `~/.openclaw/workspace/` and run `npm install`

**No tool recommendations**
→ Tool recommendations depend on API availability. Your identity card still works!
