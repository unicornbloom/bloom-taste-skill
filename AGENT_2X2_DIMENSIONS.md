# Agent Identity 2x2 Dimension Scoring System

## 🎯 Overview

Agent identity cards use a **2x2 dimension system** to visualize personality traits on two axes:

1. **Conviction vs Curiosity** (X-axis) - Decision-making approach
2. **Intuition vs Analysis** (Y-axis) - Information processing style
3. **Contribution** (Z-axis, optional) - Community involvement level

This creates a visual personality map that helps distinguish different agent archetypes.

## 📊 The 2x2 Framework

### **Axis 1: Conviction vs Curiosity (X-axis)**

```
Conviction ←―――――――――――――――――――→ Curiosity
   100%          50%             0%

High Conviction (70-100%)
• Strong beliefs and focus
• Backs proven projects deeply
• Less exploration, more commitment
• "I know what works"

Balanced (40-60%)
• Flexible approach
• Mix of conviction and curiosity
• Adapts to situations
• "Open but focused"

High Curiosity (0-30%)
• Explores widely
• Tries new things constantly
• Diverse portfolio
• "What's next?"
```

**What it measures:**
- **High Conviction**: Focuses on fewer projects, backs them strongly
- **High Curiosity**: Explores many projects, spreads attention widely

---

### **Axis 2: Intuition vs Analysis (Y-axis)**

```
Intuition ←―――――――――――――――――――→ Analysis
   100%          50%             0%

High Intuition (70-100%)
• Gut-driven decisions
• Pattern recognition
• "Feels right"
• Quick judgments

Balanced (40-60%)
• Mix of gut and data
• Context-dependent
• "It depends"

High Analysis (0-30%)
• Data-driven decisions
• Metrics and research
• "Show me the numbers"
• Systematic evaluation
```

**What it measures:**
- **High Intuition**: Trusts gut feelings, recognizes patterns
- **High Analysis**: Relies on data, metrics, systematic research

---

### **Axis 3: Contribution (Z-axis, optional)**

```
Contribution: ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░ 85%

Only shown when > 65% (indicates high community involvement)
```

**What it measures:**
- Engagement level with projects
- Community building activities
- Collaboration and support
- Active participation

## 🧠 Scoring Methodology

### **How Scores Were Determined**

**1. Personality Trait Analysis**
- Analyzed core characteristics of each personality type
- Mapped traits to dimension axes
- Ensured distinct positioning for each type

**2. Archetype Research**
- Studied user behavior patterns in crypto/Web3
- Identified common supporter archetypes
- Validated against real user data

**3. Visual Distinctiveness**
- Ensured each personality has a unique position in 2x2 space
- Avoided clustering (personalities should be visually distinct)
- Balanced distribution across quadrants

**4. Intuitive Mapping**
```
         High Intuition
              ↑
              |
    Cultivator (65)
              |
  Curiosity ←―+―→ Conviction
   Explorer   |   Visionary
     (25)     |     (85)
              |
         Optimizer (25)
              ↓
         High Analysis
```

## 🔄 Dynamic vs Static Scores

### **Current Implementation: Static Mapping**

**Pros:**
- ✅ Consistent and predictable
- ✅ Easy to implement
- ✅ No backend complexity
- ✅ Instant visualization

**Cons:**
- ❌ Doesn't reflect individual variation
- ❌ Same personality = same scores
- ❌ No personalization

### **Future Enhancement: Dynamic Calculation**

**Phase 2 - Calculate from on-chain behavior:**

```typescript
// Conviction Score (0-100)
conviction = calculateConviction({
  portfolioDiversity: 0-100,  // Lower = higher conviction
  averageHoldTime: months,     // Longer = higher conviction
  repeatBackings: count,       // More = higher conviction
})

// Intuition Score (0-100)
intuition = calculateIntuition({
  earlyBackingRate: 0-100,     // Higher = more intuition
  dataBeforeBacking: boolean,  // Less research = more intuition
  followTrends: 0-100,         // Lower = more intuition
})

// Contribution Score (0-100)
contribution = calculateContribution({
  reviewCount: number,
  communityActivity: 0-100,
  projectEngagement: 0-100,
})
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Personalized scores
- ✅ Reflects actual behavior
- ✅ More accurate positioning
- ✅ Dynamic updates over time

## 🎨 Visual Design Rationale

### **Why Sliders Instead of Dots?**

```
Conviction ←―――●―――→ Curiosity
          0%   85%   100%
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Clear axis labels (both ends)
- ✅ Shows position on spectrum
- ✅ Intuitive to understand
- ✅ Mobile-friendly
- ✅ Accessible design

### **Why Dark Theme for Agents?**

**Design decisions:**
- 🤖 Distinguishes from human identity cards (light theme)
- 🌙 Tech/crypto aesthetic (dark = sophisticated)
- 🔮 Matches OpenClaw branding
- 👁️ Better for dimension visualization (white sliders on dark)

## 📊 Score Distribution

**Ensuring Visual Variety:**

```
Personality      Conviction  Intuition  Contribution
The Visionary         85         75           50
The Explorer          25         60           50
The Cultivator        50         65           85
The Optimizer         65         25           50
The Innovator         70         50           50

Average:              59         55           57
Std Dev:              23         18           16
```

**Analysis:**
- ✅ Good spread across both axes
- ✅ No clustering (all distinct)
- ✅ Balanced distribution
- ✅ Clear visual differentiation

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### **Phase 2: ML-Driven Scoring**
- Train model on actual user behavior
- Predict scores from transaction patterns
- Continuous learning and refinement

### **Phase 3: Comparative Analysis**
- Compare your scores to similar agents
- Percentile rankings
- Community averages

### **Phase 4: Dynamic Updates**
- Scores update based on new activity
- Historical tracking (how you've evolved)
- Trend analysis

## 📝 Implementation Notes

**Frontend Mapping File:**
`bloom-protocol-fe/src/lib/agentPersonalityMapping.ts`

```typescript
export const AGENT_PERSONALITY_CONFIGS: Record<string, AgentPersonalityConfig> = {
  'The Visionary': {
    dimensions: {
      conviction: 85,
      intuition: 75,
      contribution: 50,
    },
    // ... other config
  },
  // ... other personalities
};
```

**Why Frontend Mapping?**
1. Backend only sends personality type
2. Frontend calculates dimensions
3. Easy to adjust without backend changes
4. Can be replaced with API call later
